# Question

Provide an example a pair of classes that would create a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship.

# Answer

A pair of classes that would create a "has-many"/ "belongs-to" relationship is teacher and students. There should only be one instance of a teacher that "has-many" students inside of it. On the other hand, there are many students that "belongs-to" the teacher. The "has-many" / "belongs-to" shows the relationship between the two different types of classes.
