# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

The difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created is through using the keyword `static`. By denoting the keyword `static` before the method or property name, it shows that the respective methods/properties are for the class, not the instance. The difference between how they are used is that the instance is created using the keyword word of `new` and is set to a variable. The instance may or may not use a constructor to get properties for the instance. Then, when the variable that stores the class is called, it refers to the prototype chain inside of the class in order to call the methods. On the other hand, static properties are shared with all instances of the class. Static methods should be used when it does not need instance-specific data but rather based on data about the class.
